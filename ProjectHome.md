Minecraft Admin Assistant is a simple Windows application that can be used to perform some minor admin tasks on a Minecraft server. The program connects to [the Bukkit plugin JSONAPI](https://github.com/alecgorge/jsonapi/wiki) and **will not work** without it installed on the Minecraft server.

**Minecraft Admin Assistant will only work for Minecraft Servers running Bukkit with the JSONAPI plugin installed.**
